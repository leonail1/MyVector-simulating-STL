# MyVector-simulating-STL
I'm a first year of Xiamen University,China.The files contain simple implementations of STL's vector.
simple:no allocator,no exception safety,no debug mode,no seperate iterator class and so on.
It's not that I don't add those,but I can't.If someone could add those to the Repo,I will thank him/her sincerely!
